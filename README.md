Welcome to the Market Hub Fast API project. This project is in its early stages and currently includes foundational components for a FastAPI-based application. It is entirely developed using Python.

## Project Overview

Market Hub Fast API is an API project designed using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. The project's structure and its initial components suggest a focus on setting up a basic API framework, which can be expanded for various purposes.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently includes the following directories and files:

- `data`: Presumably contains scripts or data files.
- `models`: Likely holds data models for the API.
- `utils`: Utility scripts and functions.
- `jwt_manager.py`: A script for managing JSON Web Tokens, indicating a focus on secure data transfer.
- `main.py`: The main entry point for the FastAPI application.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python package dependencies.
